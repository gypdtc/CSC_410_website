# CSC410-Pokemon-GO
CSC410 Final Project

This is the final project of our CSC410 Web Programming course shared by our team.

We plan to develop a forum focus on Pokemon Go, just like a combination of Instgram, Wechat Moment and Twitter.
In this website, user can share their pokemon go gaming experience and feelings with others and their post can be seen by people
who follow them only.

At the front, we use HTML/CSS, Javascript, Ajax, jQuery to build the UI, exchange data and handle user interactions.
For pursuing better UI, we embedded bootstrap framework as our CSS

At the backend, we use Python as our main CGI script, cooperate with SQL database.

To experience this website, you should have python2.7, Mysql database and Appache sever installed.
Also the "pymysql" package fis needed to use the MYSQL database.
Please try changing the database user and password in the cgi-bin/dbconnector.py file.

I am mainly in charge of the profile page , the search function and the friend follow/unfollow function. I created javascript functions in the frontend and created corresponding python functions in the backend. The python functions would communicate with Mysql database and respond to the ajax request through CGI.
